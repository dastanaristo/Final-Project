      <h2 class="main__title">Why It's Critical to Reduce Global Warming:</h2>
      <div class="main__intro">
        <p>Global warming is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. The Earth’s climate is changing rapidly due to human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. These activities release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the planet to warm.</p>
        <p>Here's why we need to take action now:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising Sea Levels:</strong> Melting polar ice caps and glaciers are causing sea levels to rise, putting coastal communities and entire ecosystems at risk.</li>
          <li><strong>More Extreme Weather:</strong> Global warming is leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, and droughts, which harm agriculture, wildlife, and human health.</li>
          <li><strong>Ecosystem Disruption:</strong> Many plant and animal species may not be able to adapt quickly enough to the changing climate, leading to biodiversity loss.</li>
          <li><strong>Human Health Impacts:</strong> Climate change can increase the spread of diseases, worsen air quality, and lead to food and water shortages.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic Costs:</strong> The financial impact of repairing damage from climate-related disasters is growing, affecting global economies.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="main__title">How We Can Help Reduce Global Warming:</h2>
      <div class="main__rez" id="end">
        <p>Reducing global warming requires coordinated action at both individual and global levels. Consider the following steps you can take to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Switch to renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.</li>
          <li>Use energy-efficient appliances and insulate your home to reduce energy consumption.</li>
          <li>Limit the use of single-use plastics and reduce overall waste.</li>
          <li>Promote sustainable agricultural practices and reduce meat consumption, as livestock farming produces significant methane emissions.</li>
          <li>Support policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a low-carbon economy.</li>
          <li>Plant trees and support reforestation projects, as trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.</li>
          <li>Encourage businesses and industries to adopt green practices and reduce their carbon footprint.</li>
        </ul>
